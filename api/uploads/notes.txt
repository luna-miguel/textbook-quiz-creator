The Wagner Act was established after Section 5A of the National Industrial Recovery
Act was struck down by the Supreme Court. It establishes the National Labor Relations Act
(1935), which states that workers have the right to bargain collectively through agents of their
choice, as well as the NLRB (National Labor Relations Board).
The Social Security Act (1935) was an act that required American workers to pay a
social security tax from a portion of their earnings, that gives them a return after they reach 65
years old. It created a system in which older people can retire, to prevent them from
competing in the job market, as well as to continue to facilitate spending for older people.
West Coast Hotel v. Parish was a Supreme Court case. In it, the West Coast Hotel is
sued by a worker for paying below the minimum wage established in Washington. Its ruling
disregards the previous notion that the state cannot set the wage under the Liberty of Contract
under 14th Amendment, overthrowing the ruling of Lochner v. New York, and changing the
power dynamic between Congress and the states.
NLRB v. Jones and Laughlin Steel (1937) was a Supreme Court case. The
defendant Jones and Laughlin Steel company argued that the federal government has no
jurisdiction on labor relations. The ruling struck this down with the notion that, under modern
conditions of transportation and infrastructure, all commerce is inherently interstate, and can
be regulated by Congress.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) was a federal act that established the 8-hour
work day and 40-hour work week as federal law, and anything above as overtime. It also
established the federal minimum wage.
The WPA (Works Progress Administration) was a federal agency that financed and
oversaw work projects during the Great Depression to create employment. They developed
public infrastructure that private companies would never oversee themselves, such as parks,
tunnels, bridges, highways, or airports.
